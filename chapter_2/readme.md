What directory are you in? <br>
<blockquote> pwd: /Users/raj/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2014/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_2 </blockquote>

Are you in the class directory? <br>
<blockquote> pwd: yes, at least a sub-directory of the class directory </blockquote>

Are you in your home directory? <br>	
<blockquote> pwd: no, in chapter_2 directory </blockquote>

What directory did you run that command in? <br>
<blockquote> pwd will tell me </blockquote>

To find the path with my gui:
<ol>I clicked on the finder in the toolbar, double-clicked on the harddrive icon, double-clicked the Users folder icon, double-click the raj (Home) folder icon, double-clicked the davinci_coders_t2_2014 folder icon, double-clicked the learn_command_line_exercises folder icon, and finally double-clicked the chapter_2 folder icon. </ol>
