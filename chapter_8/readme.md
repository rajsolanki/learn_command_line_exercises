The above shows me that I am in the here/are/some directory and that I can move between that directory and the temp directory.

The pushd d command stores your current directory to be gone back to when you go somewhere else. It's like saying, "remember this location." Popd takes you back to that rememebered location.

I visited several directories from the temp directory. I went to /workspace and back and to class directory and back to the temp directory and a few others. This is a very handy command that I will defeineitly use.
