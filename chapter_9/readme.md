I got the following message:

usage: rmdir [-p] directory ...

The message is telling me to use the path command to remove
the directory because there is a file within it and it won't
destroy a directory that contains anything in it unless you
force it to.

Touching a file that already exists updates the time of the file as if it was edited. It doesn't recreate the file.
